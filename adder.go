/*
Gofmt formats Go programs.
It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment.
Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file,
it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in
that directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.)
By default, gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

    gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:

    -d
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file's formatting is different than gofmt's, print diffs
        to standard output.
    -w
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file's formatting is different from gofmt's, overwrite it
        with gofmt's version. If an error occurred during overwriting,
        the original file is restored from an automatic backup.

When gofmt reads from standard input, it accepts either a full Go program
or a program fragment. A program fragment must be a syntactically
valid declaration list, statement list, or expression. When formatting
such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading
and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be
formatted by piping them through gofmt.
